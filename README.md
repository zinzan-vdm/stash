- check branches for specific items
- sometimes its easier to change repo visibility, otherwise you need to use authentication, just remember to change visibility back to private
- to download as tar or zip use `curl -L -o {name} 'https://github.com/zinzan-vdm/stash/{tarball|zipball}/{branch}'`
  - note: git doesnt mind slashes in branch names
